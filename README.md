# spinprecession

This page contains data supporting some of my papers on black-hole binary spin precessions. Most of these results are obtained with the public [precession](https://github.com/dgerosa/precession/) code. In particular, we provide animated versions of some of the figures from:

- *Effective potentials and morphological transitions for binary black-hole spin precession*. Davide Gerosa, Michael Kesden, Richard O'Shaughnessy, Emanuele Berti, Ulrich Sperhake. Phys.Rev.Lett. 114 (2015) 081103. [arXiv:1411.0674](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.0674).
 
- *A multi-timescale analysis of phase transitions in precessing black-hole binaries*. Michael Kesden, Davide Gerosa, Ulrich Sperhake, Emanuele Berti, Richard O'Shaughnessy. Phys.Rev.D 92 (2015) 064016. [arXiv:1506.03492](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03492).

- *Precessional instability in binary black holes with aligned spins*. Davide Gerosa, Michael Kesden, Richard O'Shaughnessy, Antoine Klein, Emanuele Berti, Ulrich Sperhake, Daniele Trifirò. Phys.Rev.Lett. 115 (2015) [arXiv:1506.09116](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.09116).
  
- *Surprises from the spins: astrophysics and relativity with detections of spinning black-hole mergers*. Davide Gerosa. Journal of Physics: Conf. Series 957 (2018) 012014. [arXiv:1711.10038](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10038).

Figures published in the papers are snapshots (at fixed binary separation) of these animations. References to other figures and equations in the captions correspond to those in the relevant paper. Here is a [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVjP4QK1oHumxThz2OQ91hWAill_7gdPe) containing all animations.
  
  
We also provide older animated gif from:

- *Resonant-plane locking and spin alignment in stellar-mass black-hole binaries: a diagnostic of compact-binary formation*.
Davide Gerosa, Michael Kesden, Emanuele Berti, Richard O’Shaughnessy, Ulrich Sperhake. Phys.Rev.D 87 (2013) 104028. [arXiv:1302.4442](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4442).
